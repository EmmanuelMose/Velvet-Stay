1. Project Introduction

The Hotel Booking Management System is a full-stack web application designed to simplify and automate the process of searching for hotels, viewing available rooms, making bookings, and managing hotel operations. The platform serves both regular users and administrative staff through role-based access, enabling tailored interactions and feature access depending on user privileges. The system is engineered to offer real-time availability, seamless payment integrations, support ticketing, and powerful admin-level analytics and reporting capabilities.

Designed using modern web technologies, the system leverages a scalable architecture and integrates best practices in security, testing, and user experience. The system not only enhances the convenience for end-users but also streamlines hotel management operations, ensuring efficient resource utilization and higher customer satisfaction.

2. System Architecture

Frontend: Built with React.js, Redux, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, DaisyUI

Backend: Express.js server using Drizzle ORM for database interaction

Database: PostgreSQL

Testing Stack: Unit and Integration tests via Jest, Performance testing with K6, End-to-End testing via Cypress

Fields: hotel_id (PK), name, location, address, contact_phone, category, rating, created_at, updated_at

Stores branch-level hotel information

3. Rooms Table:

Fields: room_id (PK), hotel_id (FK), room_type, price_per_night, capacity, amenities, is_available, created_at

Contains room availability, features, and pricing

4. Bookings Table:

Fields: booking_id (PK), user_id (FK), room_id (FK), check_in_date, check_out_date, total_amount, booking_status (ENUM), created_at, updated_at
